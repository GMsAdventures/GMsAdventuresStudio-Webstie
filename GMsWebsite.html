            <p>
                I AM "The Best In The World" according to myself, because I need  to be more social!
                I am currently a Film Student trying to make movies and tell stories that will Inspire people, Like Movies inspired me.
                I am also a Gamer, I love playing Video Games, and telling my own stories through some of those Video Games.
                I am aswell a Writer, I love writing stories, and creating Fictional Worlds and people that people will hate, and people who will want to be like those characters.
                I sometimes play the guitar and try to make music but thats a new thing I'm trying out. I also sing though...
                One of my best Projects is my Documentary on a popular card game called Legend of the Five Rings (L5R - shortened) the Documentary was titled "Legend of the Five Rings: An Inspiration!"
